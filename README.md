# Data-Mining

The purpose of our project is to analyze tweets from Twitter with regards to a sentimental analysis. We collect tweets linked to a social tension in Poland caused by the war in the Ukraine. We want to do that by assigning a value one for tweets indicating positive emotions, a value zero in the case of lack of emotions, and a value minus one for tweets indicating negative emotions. This goal can be achieved by using a modification of the Vader algorithm which was created by Hutto, C.J. & Gilbert, E.E. (2014). The key concept of the modification of the Vader algorithm was to provide the functionality of the original Vader algorithm, but in polish language.

The project files are in the master branch.
